For this project we used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
[Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/) ranging from 1995 to 2020. In our analysis we considered 
only workers that were employed full time (35+ hours a week) and have reported 
weekly earnings. All the wage figures in this project represent median weekly 
earnings and have been adjusted to **2022 dollars.**
