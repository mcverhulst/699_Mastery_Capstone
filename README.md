### Project statement
##### Choosing a topic
When looking for inspiration for our data science project, both of us remembered seeing articles from news outlets, blogs, and other sources stating that over the last several decades productivity in the United States had grown considerably while wages for workers have remained relatively stagnant. After doing some quick searches online we were curious to examine two questions:
1. Was this claim true?
2. If so, what was causing the gap to grow?

Answering these questions was an exciting challenge for us because neither of us studied economics in our undergraduate careers and we were curious to see if we could come to similar conclusions after our analysis.

##### Our goal
After some discussion, we decided that the ultimate goal for our project would be to build a dashboard that could convey our findings in a way that is accessible and easy to understand for the general public. We found that some of the academic and news articles we had come across in our preliminary search required a significant background in economics to understand and we wanted to build a tool that would help normal people understand how they are affected by the broader economic forces at play in the U.S.

To achieve this goal, we framed our approach as data scientists embedded within a team of economists that wanted to educate the general public. This approach led to some significant challenges and as weâ€™ll explain below.

### Challenges of Being an Embedded Data Scientist (Mike)

##### Learning a new domain on your own
Perhaps the biggest challenge we faced while assuming the role of embedded data scientists was coming into a field that was completely foreign to us and having to teach ourselves the ins and outs of that field. After choosing to study productivity and wages we spent the following 2-3 weeks reading articles from various academic journals and news outlets as well as papers published by economic think tanks such as the [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/) and the [Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/) and found that every topic related to economics is very complicated and will have major differences of opinions based on who you talk to.

For example, at the start of our research we believed that there was likely one generally accepted standard for how to measure productivity but that assumption turned out to be wrong. On a basic level, productivity is the amount of goods and services produced (output) with the amount of inputs used to produce those goods and services [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/k12/productivity-101/content/what-is-productivity/home.htm), but there is debate among economists as to which output and input measures most accurately reflect the market. As a non-expert in the field, it became very difficult to parse which measures were most accurate.

##### Unclear Methodologies
In addition to challenges posed by choosing the best metrics, many of the analysis methodologies we encountered were not reproducible. In many cases, methodology sections were incomplete or vague which prevented us from reproducing the same analysis even if we had access to the same data. In other cases, analysis was done using proprietary or unpublished data. In fact, one of the initial [articles](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/) that inspired us to examine productivity was written by the Economic Policy Institute but used unpublished data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics so we could not reproduce it.

### Data Access
The data for this project was sourced from the National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER). NBER compiled monthly data from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistic's Current Population Survey, which in turn gets its data by querying more than 50,000 households within the U.S. each month. More information and the data itself can be found on [NBER's website](https://www.nber.org/research/data/current-population-survey-cps-merged-outgoing-rotation-group-earnings-data).
